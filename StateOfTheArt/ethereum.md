# Ethereum Stack as a viable IoT based DApps development framework

Ethereum Stack consists of:
- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
- Smart Contracts 
- Ethereum Nodes
- Ethereum Client API
- End User Application

One research area that I can think of is as follows

**Status Messenger** is using ehtereum stack to create a decentralized messaging service. 

**Status Messenger** uses **Whisper** protocol to establish communications between two decentralized entities with the help of a peer-to-peer network.

The research can be done in order to establish a new protocol for indirect communication in IoT, which makes use of Whisper protocol at it's core. 

This protocol can follow the MQTT standards so that with the help of the Ethereum Client API + End User Application for this protocol can be embedded in the existing set of IoT Devices working on MQTT standards.
