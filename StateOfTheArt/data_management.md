## Trusted IoT : Blockchain : Data Management Aspect
---

In IoT and IIoT, the major data flow is centralized making a few points as single points of failures. This can be resolved by a decentralized data management approach.

Also in order to achieve the trust within the system it is very important to consider following aspects:

1. Trusted Sensing: 
    - Solution for following problem "Is every node onto the IoT network actually a node to be trusted as a data source ?"
    - This can be resolved by the use of Identifications for Every Device, i.e. if an IoT device can be recognized by the ID dispatcher, then only the Device source is authentic and valid. 
    - Validity of the Source is affected

2. Trusted Storage:
    - Providing read and write access to a few sets of devices provides security from the untrusted tampering of the data. 
    - This can be used as an **on-chain** technology with the help of the distributed ledger service
    - A BaaS (Blockchain as a Service) can be reused in order to be industry compliant

3. Trusted Communication : 
    - Needed to be introduced in a predeployed stack of blockchain and P2P network
    - This maximizes the security of the Peer to Peer comminication protocol itself

4. Trusted Networking:
    - With this, we can consider the routing more reliable than that of the decentralized counterparts of IoT networking
    - Provides multiple perspectives for the same destinations in the P2P network

5. Trusted Computing:
    - All the participants have to maintain the degree of exposure for the data
    - Some sort of cryptography is needed in order to acheive the trust within the computing entities
    - Data exposure is highly affected by the selection of blockchain

## Permissioned Vs Permissionless 
- Known parties take part in transactions vs anyone can take part in the transactions
- Nominated nodes validate the data vs anyone can see the ledger data
- ledger is transparent and accountable vs needs very high degree of trust
