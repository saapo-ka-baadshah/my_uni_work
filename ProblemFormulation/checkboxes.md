### Question 1 : <Question Summary>

**Proposition of _WhisperTT_ (Whisper based Telemetry Transport) Protocol. Effects of _WhisperTT_ on transaction counts and Latency.**

| Aspects            | Qualities                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| - [x] Focused      | Specific sources: WhisperTT and Specific Tragets: transaction counts and Latencies              |
| - [x] Researchable | Will need the protocol _WhisperTT_ to be developed and a security sense Metric to be formulated |
| - [x] Feasible     | Yes, since the material to develop such a protocol has already been formalized                  |
| - [x] Specific     | Transaction Counts and Latencies                                                                |
| - [x] Complex      | Yes                                                                                             |
| - [ ] Relevant     | Yes, Relevant from the IoT perspective.                                                         |

**Comments** : More towards formulation of the protocol
